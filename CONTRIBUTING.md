### MyPy Type Checking and MyPyC Compilation
- MyPy is used to statically type check the codebase. This catches a lot of bugs during development, and also speeds up the game with MyPyC compilation.
- After making changes, please run `mypy --strict path/to/kessler_game.py` to type check your changes, and make sure there are no errors.
- Once there are no errors, please also try compiling wheels with MyPyC, which use these static type hints to generate compiled extension modules which allow this game to run much more efficiently.
- To compile the game, type `python setup_mypyc.py bdist_wheel` within the root of the repo, where setup_mypyc.py lives. If all is successful, a platform-specific wheel will be placed in dist/
